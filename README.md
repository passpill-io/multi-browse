# Multibrowse

A chrome extension to navigate multiple sites in one chrome tab. Multibrowse is part of the [PassPill](https://passpill.io) project, we like to create open source apps and [write articles](https://medium.com/passpill-project) about them! If you like it, consider [support the project](https://www.patreon.com/passpillproject) and to keep nice tools like multibrowse alive.

This repo started from the great [chrome extension webpack boilerplate](https://github.com/samuelsimoes/chrome-extension-webpack-boilerplate).
